# Notion

## Shallow size
**Shallow size** of an object is the amount of memory allocated to store the object itself, not taking into account the referenced objects (指自身，不含引用). 
- Shallow size of a regular (non-array) object depends on the number and types of its fields(非数组时，依赖自身field的数量和类型). 
- Shallow size of an array depends on the array length and the type of its elements (objects, primitive types)(数组时，数组长度及每个element的类型). 
- Shallow size of a set of objects represents the sum of shallow sizes of all objects in the set.

## Retained size

**Retained size** of an object is its shallow size plus the shallow sizes of the objects that are accessible, (自身的shallow size及**直接或间接**引用对象(仅从此对象)的shallow size) directly or indirectly, **only** from this object. In other words, the retained size represents the amount of memory that will be freed by the garbage collector when this object is collected(Retained size指，释放该对象时，能够释放的所有内存；如果A引用S、C也引用S，则释放A时，不会释放S，因此，S不被计算进A的Retained Size).

# I.E.

To better understand the notion of the **retained size**, let us look at the following examples:

In order to measure the retained sizes, all objects in memory are treated as nodes of a graph where its edges represent references from objects to objects.
There are also special nodes - _GC root_ objects, which will not be collected by _Garbage Collector_ at the time of measuring (read more about [GC roots](https://www.yourkit.com/docs/java/help/gc_roots.jsp)).

The pictures below show the same set of objects, but with varying internal references.

<div style="float:right;border:solid 1px 000;"><img alt="figure 2" src="http://anocelot-wiki.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/java/jvm/retained_objects_figure_2.gif">figure 2</div>

<div style="float:none;clear:both;">
</div>

Let us consider _obj1_.  
As you can see, in both pictures we have highlighted all of the objects that are directly or indirectly accessed **only** by _obj1_.
If you look at Figure 1, you will see that _obj3_ is not highlighted,
because it is also referenced by a _GC root_ object. On Figure 2, however, it is already included into
the retained set, unlike _obj5_, which is still referenced by _GC root_.

Thus, the retained size of _obj1_ will represent the following respective values:

* For Figure 1: the sum of shallow sizes of _obj1_, _obj2_ and _obj4_
* For Figure 2: the sum of shallow sizes of _obj1_, _obj2_, _obj3_ and _obj4_

Looking at _obj2_, however, we see that its retained size in the above cases will be:

* For Figure 1: the sum of shallow sizes of _obj2_ and _obj4_
* For Figure 2: the sum of shallow sizes of _obj2_, _obj3_ and _obj4_

In general, retained size is an integral measure, which helps to understand the structure (clustering) of memory
and the dependencies between object subgraphs, as well as find potential roots of those subgraphs.
